## Features

- **Video Processing**: Efficiently process video files to extract frames for analysis.
- **Feature Extraction**: Utilize advanced techniques to extract meaningful features from video data.
- **Model Training**: Train a machine learning model based on the extracted features.
- **Evaluation**: Assess the performance of the model with various metrics.

## Requirements

This project requires the following Python libraries:
- `opencv-python` for video processing.
- `numpy` for numerical operations.
- `pandas` for data manipulation.
- `scikit-learn` for machine learning model training and evaluation.
- `matplotlib` for data visualization.
- Any other dependencies specified in the notebook.

You can install these libraries using the `requirements.txt` file provided in the repository.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/jaidh01/Computer-Vision-Projects.git
   cd Computer-Vision-Projects/DogBreedClassification/Generate ML model with video
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:

## Usage

1. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook main.ipynb
   ```

2. Follow the instructions in the notebook to record/upload your video file and adjust any parameters as needed.

3. Run the cells sequentially to process the video and train the ML model.

## Complete Process Guide

1. **Video Input**: Start by recording your video file into the designated section of the notebook.
  
2. **Frame Extraction**: The notebook will automatically extract frames from the uploaded video, allowing you to analyze individual frames for feature extraction.

3. **Labelling Extracted Data**: You can designated some keys to label your data, as the video runs press the designated key of the label, to give that point that perticular label.

4. **Data Preparation**: After extracting features, you will end up with a .csv file, which you can use for training your model by splitting it into training and testing sets.

5. **Model Selection**: You can choose from various machine learning models (e.g., Decision Trees, Random Forests, etc.) according to your need.

6. **Training**: Train the selected model using the prepared dataset.

7. **Evaluation**: Once the model is trained, evaluate its performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall.

8. **Visualization**: Finally, visualize the results to better understand how the model performs.

## Sample Example

To facilitate understanding of the whole process, we have included a sample example in the notebook. This example walks you through the steps of using a sample video file, demonstrating how to process the video, extract features, train a model, and evaluate its performance. 

Feel free to modify the sample example to work with your own video files and adjust parameters as needed.

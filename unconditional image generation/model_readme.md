# Diffusion Model Image Generation

This project demonstrates how to use a pre-trained diffusion model from the Hugging Face `diffusers` library to generate images. Specifically, this example uses the Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model (DDPM) to generate a random image based on CIFAR-10 data.

## Features

- Generates images using the `google/ddpm-cifar10-32` model.
- Supports faster inference with alternative pipelines like DDIM or PNDM.
- Saves the generated image as a `.png` file.

## Requirements

To run this project, you'll need to install the following dependencies. You can install them by running:


```python
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
# **Required Packages**

diffusers: A library for running state-of-the-art diffusion models.
torch: PyTorch for deep learning.
transformers: (Optional) Needed if you are loading a Hugging Face model that requires transformer capabilities.
Installation
Clone the repository:
```python
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/diffusion-model-image-generation.git
```
```python
cd diffusion-model-image-generation
```
Install the required packages:

```python
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
How to Use
Once the environment is set up, you can run the script to generate an image.

```python
from diffusers import DDPMPipeline, DDIMPipeline, PNDMPipeline

model_id = "google/ddpm-cifar10-32"

# Load the model and scheduler
ddpm = DDPMPipeline.from_pretrained(model_id)

# Generate the image
image = ddpm().images[0]

# Save the image to a file
image.save("ddpm_generated_image.png")
```
Using Alternative Pipelines
You can switch to faster pipelines for inference by replacing DDPMPipeline with DDIMPipeline or PNDMPipeline in the code.

Output
The generated image will be saved in the working directory as ddpm_generated_image.png.

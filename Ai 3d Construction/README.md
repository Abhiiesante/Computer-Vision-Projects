# AI 3D Reconstruction

## Project Overview

This project focuses on creating 3D models from 2D images using advanced AI techniques. By utilizing deep learning algorithms and disparity maps, we aim to reconstruct three-dimensional structures from two-dimensional input data.

To set up the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <https://github.com/Aryan-Chharia/Computer-Vision-Projects/pull/222>
   cd ai-3d-reconstruction
 
## Installing Required Libraries 

pip install opencv-python opencv-contrib-python numpy matplotlib


## Prepare your image and run the script like this 

python main.py --input <path_to_your_images> 

## What's Disparity Map ?

Think of how you see the world with both eyes. Each eye views things from a slightly different angle, helping your brain gauge depth. 
Disparity maps do the same for computers! By comparing two or more images taken from different viewpoints, they highlight the differences in object positions. It’s this smart technique that enables computers to turn flat images into stunning 3D models!

## Why Disparity Map Matter ?

Bringing 3D to Life: Disparity maps are the backbone of 3D reconstruction. They give depth to our flat images, helping us create realistic 3D models.
Smart Detection: They allow computers to recognize and track objects in space, making applications smarter and more responsive.
Navigating the World: In robotics and autonomous vehicles, disparity maps help detect obstacles and measure distances, making navigation safer.

## Real Life Application 

In image you can see FADED BLACK and FADED WHITE: What do they mean ?

Faded Black: Think of this as the "faraway land" on the map. Areas that appear faded black indicate low disparity values, meaning those objects are quite distant from the camera. 
Faded White: This is the "up-close and personal" area! Faded white regions indicate high disparity values, signifying that these objects are close to the camera. They usually appear clearer and more detailed, allowing us to capture the essence of the subject.

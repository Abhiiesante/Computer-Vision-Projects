Image Caption Generator
This project implements an image caption generator using deep learning techniques. It combines computer vision and natural language processing to generate descriptive captions for input images.

Features

Image feature extraction using pre-trained CNN models (VGG16 and ResNet50)
Text preprocessing and tokenization
Sequence generation using LSTM networks
Integration of vision and language models for caption generation

Dependencies
The project requires the following Python libraries:

pandas
numpy
matplotlib
keras
nltk
json
pickle


Install the required packages:
Copypip install pandas numpy matplotlib keras nltk

Download the NLTK stopwords dataset:
pythonCopyimport nltk
nltk.download('stopwords')


Model Architecture
This project uses a combination of:

A CNN (VGG16 or ResNet50) for image feature extraction
An LSTM network for sequence generation

The model architecture combines these components to generate captions based on input images.
